**Career in Data Science Requires Computer Science Basics**

It doesn't matter if you are in business, marketing, the humanities, social sciences or a STEM field; you will inevitably find yourself facing a situation where a data scientist would be useful. Therefore, it pays to have at least an introductory knowledge of data science in order to have some of the skills needed when hiring one. Computer Science basics are also an essential part of being able to use machine learning techniques effectively.

**Get an Intro to Data Science Course**

Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to teach themselves. Machine learning uses data to make predictions and then continually learn from new information. With machine learning, machines are able to automate data-driven tasks like searching for faces in photos or translating languages.

**Learn Python or R**

Now that you've decided to start learning machine learning, you need to decide what tool to use. There are many options available, but the most popular languages right now are Python and R. They have a few differences, with Python being more clear and concise, while R is often used in universities and research settings. Personally I prefer Python because it's easier for beginners to grasp quickly, but ultimately it comes down to your personal preference. To get started with either language head over to python or r-tutorials for an introduction on the basics of each programming language

**Download The Anaconda Distribution**

Anaconda is an easy-to-install package that includes over 100 popular packages for data science and machine learning such as Python, R, Jupyter Notebook, Julia, Miniconda, Spyder IDE (Python), NumPy and more. Machine learning projects can be run in a Windows/MacOS environment with GPU support.

**Use Jupyter Notebooks**

If you want to start learning machine learning, where do you start? One good place is with a free book that shows how to use Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory programming, interactive plotting and analyzing data, and developing machine learning models. After downloading Anaconda, the Python Distribution for Data Science (which includes Jupyter Notebook), use pip to install matplotlib and scikit-learn:

`pip install matplotlib pip install scikit-learn`

**Practice, Practice, Practice**

So, what’s the best way to start learning machine learning? Well, you don’t need to wait for a class; you can jump right in by practicing! The easiest way to do this is by starting a Kaggle competition. There are also many free tutorials on YouTube. All of these avenues are great for getting you started with the basics. The more you practice, the better at machine learning you’ll become!



**Check Out Our Webinar on Big Data Analytics with Python**

We are running a webinar next week on how you can start learning machine learning today. Topics include: 

1. Why you should start learning machine learning today and why Python is an ideal language for that. 
2. Overview of the data analysis lifecycle. 
3. Determining your use case or problem space. 
4. How to explore your data sets with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries in order to better understand what techniques would be best for your use case or problem space. We will show live coding examples in Python from beginning to end, so that participants get hands-on experience with some of the most popular tools for analyzing data sets!

**Find a Mentor or Fellow Student**

Your best bet is to find a mentor. Many people in the field work as mentors, in either formal or informal roles. This includes professors at universities and other academic institutions, industry practitioners, and other entrepreneurs or technologists who are successful at what they do. A mentor can give you time-sensitive input on your progress, feedback on your ideas or early versions of your product, coaching when you need motivation or help prioritizing what to focus on next, and introductions to their networks when you need help fundraising or scaling. You can also find a peer group in the form of a local meetup group with other aspiring machine learners.
