**Business Intelligence Defined**

Business intelligence (BI) refers to the use of software systems to organize data for decision-making. With the help of business intelligence, you can make better decisions by quickly analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data from all aspects of your business operations. For example, if you have to choose between two new products to sell in your store, having the tools needed for business intelligence can help you compare customer feedback, product sales records, and other key metrics in order to decide which product will perform better. A good business intelligence system includes features like dashboards that summarize important information at a glance so you can easily monitor how well your business is doing.



**What Is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning has been around for decades, but it's only recently that advances in artificial intelligence have made machine learning feasible to implement on a wide scale. And, with more and machine-learning companies cropping up every day, this tech has finally gone mainstream. The idea is quite simple: machines learn from data so the more data they get the better the predictions they can make about outcomes. For example, an online retailer might want to know what products shoppers are most likely to buy together. With machine learning, the company could use past purchase data and tell what other items customers tend to buy when they purchase a certain item. That’s not all though; machine learning can also be used for fraud detection and supply chain management among other applications.



**Artificial Intelligence in Business**

Business intelligence is just one way artificial intelligence is being used to make more informed decisions. AI systems are also helping automate a number of processes, such as data entry and analyzing the results. From tasks that involve creativity, like writing reports or preparing presentations, to data processing tasks, AI is making many aspects of business easier and more efficient. One area where this has been most helpful is with customer service interactions. For example, in one study by SAP SE it was found that AI-driven virtual assistants helped answer customers’ questions at a rate six times higher than their human counterparts—and there were no complaints about rudeness! 

By integrating technologies like machine learning and natural language processing into your enterprise’s systems, you can take advantage of these benefits for yourself.



**The Role of Big Data In Business Intelligence**

Business intelligence (BI) is the process of utilizing data collected from a business to help make better decisions and for general company guidance. It covers many things including data analysis, use of reporting tools, and training to understand what the metrics are saying about a company's health. One of the most common applications for BI is using big data to help determine what might be popular in different markets. An analytics team can often sift through huge amounts of information gathered from all over the world in order to see which products or services have potential based on sales or other factors that might show popularity. This is much more efficient than having someone examine one market at a time because it makes sense to look at global trends before they happen.
