**What Is Figma ?**

Figma has been called a Solid Sketch alternative and a prototyping tool to rival the likes of Adobe XD and Microsoft PowerPoint. From the word go, Figma boasts an extensive range of features that lend themselves nicely to UI/UX designers, website developers, and even professionals in other industries such as engineering. To put it simply, Figma is a vector interface design and prototyping tool that is primarily browser-based. The program enables users to edit files directly on their browser without needing any additional software or plugins. For those with limited bandwidth or data caps, this means you can make edits from anywhere around the world without having to worry about data charges. In terms of usability, Figma also offers many intuitive shortcuts with key combinations which enable quick access to common editing tasks like drawing straight lines or manipulating shapes. It also supports uploading fonts that can be shared with others on your team and uses pre-installed libraries so you don't have to spend time hunting for fonts on Google Fonts every time you need one!

**What is Adobe XD?**

Adobe XD is a vector-based design tool that’s mainly used for designing user interfaces (UI). Unlike Sketch, which is mainly used for app design and working with pixels, XD works at the vector level. It’s designed to be fast and easy to use. Some designers who work mainly in UI (User Interface) find it more intuitive and faster than Sketch for designing interfaces, prototypes and high-fidelity visual designs. If you’re a website developer who does much of their design work on the front end (e.g., HTML markup) then XD can be a great choice because it works seamlessly with code tools like Webflow.

**Figma vs Adobe XD: Features Comparison**

At a first glance, the Figma vs Adobe XD showdown seems fairly similar. Both programs are UI/UX design applications that have many of the same features in terms of interface and what you can create. However, there are a few small differences between the two programs that make Figma more user-friendly. One of the best qualities about Figma is the intuitive workflow and editing tools available to help you when designing a product.

**Supported Platforms**

Figma offers compatibility with both macOS and Windows operating systems, whereas Adobe XD is limited to a single OS. This one has a huge advantage if you need to work on files from different devices or share them with people in your team. Figma also has significantly more collaboration options. In addition to sharing projects through email and Dropbox, Figma allows you to sync design documents with GDrive and collaborate via the Figma web editor with those who don't have the software installed on their computers.

**Interface**

For UI/UX designers, Figma may have the upper hand. For more traditional designers and illustrators, Adobe may be the better choice. The winner interface is really a matter of personal preference but Figma just edges out over adobe XD in terms of ease of use and tools that are available to you.

**Design and Layout Tools**

Both Figma and Adobe XD offer a wide range of design tools, including vector drawing, but Figma has more powerful design and collaboration features. Adobe XD is available to anyone as a cloud-based app, whereas Figma has three pricing tiers to accommodate different budgets and needs. There are plenty of other differences between the two programs, which are outlined in the infographic below.

**Responsive Design**

Both Figma and Adobe XD support a design process that encompasses desktop and mobile design. Figma has tools built in to handle responsive design, while Adobe XD relies on CSS extensions (Stylish, or Swift). Regardless of which tool you choose, it's important to be comfortable with the other option just in case.

**Creating and Managing Design Systems**

If you’re working on a single client project as a UX design freelancer, Figma may be the best option for you. However, if you’re working on a multitude of client projects at the same time or you need to collaborate more with your team, Adobe XD is a much better tool.



**Collaboration and Sharing**

As a web based design app, Figma is built with team collaboration front and center. You can invite people to work on your files from anywhere in the world and compare versions without worrying about sending large files back and forth. When you set up a team, Figma makes sure everyone has the latest version of a design so that everyone is on the same page.
