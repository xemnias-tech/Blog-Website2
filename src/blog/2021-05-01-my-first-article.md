**A Short Overview of SEO**

If you've ever been curious about what SEO is, it stands for Search Engine Optimization. Essentially, this just means optimizing your visibility on search engines like Google and Bing. This may sound like a great idea because no one wants to be lost in the dark corner of the internet where people never find them. However, if you don't know what you're doing when it comes to getting your business to rank higher on search engines then this can actually do more harm than good.

**How can SEO help your Business?**

 Well, it can help you stand out from your competitors. SEO optimizes your visibility online by determining how relevant and beneficial a particular website is to search engine users. This leads to more traffic and new customers as they are drawn in by all of your amazing content! The benefits, however, don’t stop there! When search engines rank a website high on their results pages, it’s because they have determined that site to be an authority on a specific topic.

**How SEO Works**

Search engines like Google use crawlers to find keywords and then rank a webpage based on the relevancy to those words. On their journey, the crawler indexes a webpage's content and compares it against other pages on the same site as well as on other sites across the web. Crawlers crawl through certain parts of your website over and over again, so if they don't see what they are looking for, they might not get past that page.

**Keyword Analysis**

The first step to good SEO is discovering the keywords you want to target with your content. Many keyword research tools are available for purchase on the internet and some are offered for free. A few common examples include Google Adwords, Google Trends, Yahoo Query Tool, and WordTracker. Once you have decided on a target keyword, be sure to write a few articles that contain only that word or phrase.

**Backlink building**

Before you get started, it's important to determine which keywords your business will rank well for. The best way to do this is to take a look at your competitor's ranking and see what words they are ranking well for. Once you have figured out the keywords that your site needs to rank on, it's time to use some keyword research tools (like Google Adwords) and put together a list of the best keywords that your site should be targeting.

**Content creation**

Search Engine Optimization (or SEO) is the process that allows websites to increase their ranking on search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. SEO helps you achieve visibility in your industry and ensures that customers will be able to find your business more easily. And if they can find you more easily, they're more likely to make a purchase with you. When properly executed, good SEO provides an edge over competition by providing an online footprint that rivals those of much larger organizations.

**Visibility Attracts Clientele**

Curious about the benefits of SEO? We'll cover them in this blog. Better ranking means more visibility, which can ultimately lead to higher quality leads. A better ranking also helps show off your expertise to new potential clients. There are two types of search engine optimization – organic and paid.
