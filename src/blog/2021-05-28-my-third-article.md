**1) The Best Time to Post**

Just because Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram post to their websites at the same time doesn't mean you should as well. Posts later in the day on Monday and Tuesday receive more engagement than posts made earlier in the week, but Thursday afternoon through Sunday evenings see the most engagement of all. Other studies have found that posting content on Wednesday evening is best for reaching audiences.

What are your thoughts?



**2) Images vs. Text**

Whether you've already got a plan in place or are just looking for some direction, we have 10 data-driven content strategies that can take your marketing to the next level. Some of these ideas may sound out of the box or be perceived as an extra expense; however, research has shown these new and exciting strategies will not only increase awareness but also gain more interest in what you're selling.



**3) The Right CTA for Post**s

Every social media post needs a call to action. Your most important ones are for signing up for your newsletter, following you on Facebook, and following you on Twitter. Place these buttons at the top of the post, in one place so it's easy for readers to find. Additionally, make sure that any CTAs don't compete with the content in your post--they should always be clearly distinguishable and related to the message you're sending out.



**4) How To Cut Through the Clutter on Social Media**

Social media is more than an interactive promotional tool. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest are where your audience will be searching for information about your company. In order to capture their attention you need to have strong content on these channels. What follows are 10 data-driven content strategies that will help cut through the clutter and make sure you reach the people who matter most.



**5) Take Advantage of Natural Engagement with Live Videos**

Capturing video on the go is as easy as tapping a button on your phone. But before you hit record, make sure to:

\- Be ready and know what you're going to say. You'll need all the time that's allotted for recording because videos cannot be edited after they're recorded. 

\- Use quality recording equipment.



**6) Share Valuable Things With Your Audience**

Marketing isn't about telling people about your product, it's about helping them find it. And with data, you can do that more effectively.



**7) Just Ask Questions**

What are some ways to create content?

Make your own personal website, blog, newsletter or any other forms of content that your clients would want to read. Remember to keep the articles as up-to-date as possible. This is important because websites lose their ranking in search engines if they aren't updated regularly. Another way is by writing an eBook and distributing it on places like Amazon and Barnes & Noble, making sure that you pick a relevant topic.



**8) Customize Each Piece of Content for Each Social Platform**

Each social platform has a different audience and demographic, so it's important to tailor your content accordingly. If you share too much on one channel, you may not be providing enough variety for people to keep coming back.



**9) Automate What Works, But Know When to Check-in**

The first step is to get as much data as possible, which we can do by taking advantage of a number of online tools and services that measure what people are saying about our brand. Tools like BuzzSumo, Google Alerts, Google Analytics, Hootsuite and Lasso can be used to determine what content on your website gets the most traction or engagement. Armed with this information you can better understand your customers and their buying habits in order to drive sales and engagement with your content marketing strategy.
